        # With w0 = sqrt(K/M) the undamped natural frequency and zeta the damping ratio:
        #
        #   1) Undamped natural frequency:  w0            (here self.fs)
        #      The frequency where the mass reactance and the suspension stiffness
        #      reactance exactly cancel.
        #
        #   2) Damped natural frequency:    w0*sqrt(1 - zeta**2)
        #      The frequency of the FREE, decaying oscillation the cone rings at when
        #      plucked and released -- a transient / pole property. It is the SAME for
        #      displacement, velocity and acceleration, and exists for zeta < 1.
        #
        #   3) Response-peak frequency:     (steady-state, sinusoidally driven)
        #      The frequency at which the DRIVEN amplitude is largest. This one depends
        #      on WHICH quantity is observed, and so is generally different from (2):
        #        - displacement peak:  w0*sqrt(1 - 2*zeta**2)   (BELOW w0)
        #        - velocity peak:      w0                        (AT w0)
        #        - acceleration peak:  w0/sqrt(1 - 2*zeta**2)   (ABOVE w0)
        #      Why displacement peaks below w0: at w0 the mass and stiffness cancel, so
        #      the force sees only the damper and VELOCITY is maximal there. Since
        #      displacement = velocity / w, dividing by a smaller w just below w0 makes
        #      the displacement larger -- pushing its peak below w0.
        #
        # (2) and (3) are answers to two different experiments -- "pluck it and hear it
        # ring" vs "drive it and find the biggest steady response" -- so there is no
        # reason for them to coincide. They all collapse onto w0 as zeta -> 0.
        #
        # The value below is the DISPLACEMENT response peak (the "bump" on the
        # excursion/SPL curve). It is real only for zeta < 1/sqrt(2) (Qts > 0.707);
