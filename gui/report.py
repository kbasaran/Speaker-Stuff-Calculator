"""Generation of the standalone PDF report.

The report is written as HTML against a template and then laid out onto A4
sheets by the Qt WebEngine, the same engine that draws a page in a browser.
Going through HTML keeps the whole design of the document
-- its two columns, its tables, where its pages break -- in one stylesheet that
can be opened and tried out in a browser, rather than in drawing calls here.

The result is one self-contained file: the results summary, the input-form
values that the summary does not already carry, and the graphs as embedded
PNGs. Nothing is linked from outside, so the document can be mailed or archived
on its own.

The graphs are drawn by a second, never-shown MatplotlibWidget rather than by
the one on screen. That keeps every styling decision (log-frequency ticks,
grids, the per-plot y-limit policies, legend ordering) in one place instead of
being re-implemented here, and it leaves the user's current graph selection
untouched while the report is built.
