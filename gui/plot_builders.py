"""Pure plot-data builders for the main window graph.

Each builder takes the current speaker system plus the excitation context and
returns a :class:`PlotSpec` describing the curves to draw and how to label the
axes. The builders contain no Qt dependency, so they can be unit-tested against
known speaker systems independently of the GUI.

The main window looks up a builder in :data:`PLOT_BUILDERS` by the id of the
selected graph-data choice and applies the returned spec to its graph widget.
